# Pick Up Stitch

This is a simple console application to help you figure out the most efficient way to pick up stitches when knitting or crocheting.

Sometimes, a pattern will tell you to pick up a certain number of stitches out a total, but it won't tell you how to distribute the picked up stitches. For instance, if you are picking up fifty stitches out of one hundred, the most even way to pick them up is in a repeating pattern of one on, one off; if you're picking up fifty out of one hundred fifty stitches, the repeating pattern would be one on, two off. Those ratios are easy enough to figure out, but I'm guessing if you found this application, you know it never divides so nicely. And when the pattern doesn't include the specific way to pick up, this math can be tricky! This application is the solution you need. It takes two arguments - total number of stitches and number of stitches to pick up - and returns the best way to pick up stitches.
